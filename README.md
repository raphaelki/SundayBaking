# Sunday Baking Android App

## Project Overview

Android sample app that retrieves bake recipes from a [provided source](http://go.udacity.com/android-baking-app-json) and displays baking guidance and instruction videos.\
This is the 3rd project of the [Android Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801).

I also took the chance to get familiar with some of the Android Architecture Components as there were no restrictions from Udacity on which database to use or how to forward the data from the database to the UI. Some parts of the code are "stolen" from the sample apps of the [Android Architecture Components](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components) and the [Android Architecture Blueprints](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture).

## Android concepts used

- **Fragment** for swapping views at runtime
- **Widget** for showing recipe shopping lists on the home screen
